This is the bblfish branch of the Apache version of Clerezza ( http://clerezza.org/ ).
This branch is geared towards Social Web development as explained by http://bblfish.net/ 
Please clone the github repository and notify https://github.com/bblfish/clerezza
of changes you want integrated.

COMPILING
=========

We are using Java 7

$ git clone https://github.com/bblfish/clerezza.git
$ cd parent
$ export MAVEN_OPTS='-XX:MaxPermSize=248M -Xmx512m -XX:-UseSplitVerifier' 
$ mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dgpg.skip=true

RUNNING in HTTPS mode
=====================

You can then change into one of the platform.launcher.{tdb,sesame,mulgara} directories. The following is valid for Jena's TDB database. 

$ bin/run.sh

will run the project in the run directory after starting it in WebID enabled HTTPS mode with certificate requests in WANT mode. 

To run in debug mode add the following two parameters

  -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005

The above will start a https://webid.info/ enabled clerezza on port 8443  

  You need to have created yourself a keystore. If you want the keystore to function with the major browsers without error messages it needs to have been signed by a certification authority.

NOTES
=====

1. You can get free CA server certificates for your server from https://www.startssl.com/
2. The server as set up will request a client certificate from the client automatically if he has one.
  To make this more userfriendly will require improving the jetty TLS layer or replacing it with netty.
  That it can be done is shown by the netty server at https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/read-write-web/
